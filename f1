RIP

sukshma verse RIP(the story is narrated by TWO Pitras one of them was prrett and turned himself to prrets )

PITRAA vs PRREETS 

A whole unseen world right under our nose which is there with us like our Angels that exist for real unseen undetected imessureable by any device...Their ansisters which either helps them(us human beings) , protect them , gaurd them , 
guide them(without the person's knowledge) or distract them , punish them , curse them according to their karma, deeds and misbehaivour to elders, ot other pittrrs or human beings ...

developmnt or growth leads only when there is a need ...for ex. if humans could survive only on oxigen no need to eat , so a trillian dollar industry would collaps.... a millions of people would do something ... no words like hunger,food, famine would even exist ..aadhi problem solve ho jaati or paida bhi nahi hoti.....
